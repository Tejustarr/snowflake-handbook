# Stages and File Formats in Snowflake

Stages and file formats are two essential components in Snowflakeâ€™s data loading and unloading workflow.  
Understanding them will help you design efficient, reusable, and scalable pipelines.

## 1. What is a Stage?

A **stage** is a storage location for files before they are loaded into Snowflake (or after they are unloaded).  
Think of it as a **landing zone** for your data.

### Types of Stages
1. **User Stage**
   - Automatically created for every user.  
   - Accessed via `@~`.  
   - Temporary and private to that user.  

2. **Table Stage**
   - Automatically created for every table.  
   - Accessed via `@%table_name`.  
   - Stores files intended for that specific table.  

3. **Internal Named Stage**
   - Explicitly created and managed by the user.  
   - Accessed via `@stage_name`.  
   - Can be reused across multiple tables.  

4. **External Stage**
   - References cloud storage (e.g., S3, Azure Blob, GCS).  
   - Requires credentials or integration objects.  
   - Accessed via `@stage_name` pointing to external storage.  

ðŸ“Œ Example:
```sql
-- Create an internal named stage
CREATE STAGE my_stage;

-- Create an external stage pointing to S3
CREATE STAGE my_s3_stage
URL='s3://my-bucket/data/'
CREDENTIALS=(AWS_KEY_ID='...' AWS_SECRET_KEY='...');
```

## 2. File Formats

A **file format** defines how Snowflake should interpret files when loading or unloading.  
Instead of redefining options each time, you can create reusable file format objects.

### Supported File Types
- CSV  
- JSON  
- Avro  
- ORC  
- Parquet  
- XML (beta feature in some regions)  

### Creating a File Format
```sql
CREATE FILE FORMAT my_csv_format
TYPE = 'CSV'
FIELD_DELIMITER = ','
SKIP_HEADER = 1
NULL_IF = ('NULL', 'null');
```

### Using File Formats
When loading data:
```sql
COPY INTO customers
FROM @my_stage/customers.csv
FILE_FORMAT = (FORMAT_NAME = my_csv_format);
```

When unloading data:
```sql
COPY INTO @my_stage/export/
FROM customers
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'CSV' FIELD_DELIMITER = '|');
```

## 3. Temporary vs. Permanent Objects

- **Temporary Stages/File Formats**
  - Exist only for the duration of a session.  
  - Useful for testing.  

- **Permanent Stages/File Formats**
  - Persist until explicitly dropped.  
  - Recommended for production pipelines.  

---

## 4. Best Practices

- Use **named stages** for reusable pipelines.  
- Create **standardized file formats** across teams for consistency.  
- Compress large files (e.g., gzip, parquet) before loading to save space and time.  
- Use **partitioned folders** in external stages (e.g., S3) for efficient data ingestion.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaway
Stages act as the **gateway** for loading and unloading data in Snowflake, while file formats define **how the data is read or written**.  
Together, they make data ingestion pipelines **modular, reusable, and efficient**.
