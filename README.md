# ❄️ Snowflake Handbook

A **knowledge-only guide** to learning Snowflake — structured like a textbook with four levels of study:  
**Basic → Intermediate → Advanced → Expert**.  

This repo is designed for readers who want to **understand Snowflake concepts deeply** without hands-on exercises.  
It also includes **cheatsheets, best practices, diagrams, comparisons, and resources** to make learning complete.

## 📚 Structure of the Handbook

The handbook is divided into four progressive levels:

1. **Basic** → Foundations of Snowflake (architecture, concepts, SQL basics).  
2. **Intermediate** → Working with data (loading, stages, warehouses, security).  
3. **Advanced** → Optimizations and advanced features (time travel, performance, pipelines).  
4. **Expert** → Enterprise-level strategies (data sharing, multi-cloud, compliance, integrations).  

Extras include **cheatsheets, best practices, diagrams, glossary, and external resources**.
