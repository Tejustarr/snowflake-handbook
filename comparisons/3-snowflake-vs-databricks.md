# Snowflake vs. Databricks

Snowflake and Databricks are often compared, but they target different primary use cases: **data warehousing vs. data lakehouse/AI**.

---

## 1. Focus
- **Snowflake** â†’ Data warehousing, BI, and analytics.  
- **Databricks** â†’ Data science, machine learning, data engineering (Lakehouse).  

---

## 2. Architecture
- **Snowflake** â†’ Cloud data platform with separation of compute and storage; SQL-first.  
- **Databricks** â†’ Built on Apache Spark; optimized for big data processing and ML pipelines.  

---

## 3. Pricing
- **Snowflake** â†’ Pay for compute (warehouses) + storage.  
- **Databricks** â†’ Pay for compute clusters (DBUs) + storage.  

---

## 4. Performance
- **Snowflake** â†’ Optimized for SQL queries, joins, BI dashboards.  
- **Databricks** â†’ Optimized for batch processing, ML training, streaming.  

---

## 5. Ecosystem
- **Snowflake** â†’ BI/ETL integrations, SQL-first workflows.  
- **Databricks** â†’ Strong integration with ML/AI tools (MLflow, TensorFlow, PyTorch).  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaway
- Choose **Snowflake** if your primary need is **analytics and BI at scale**.  
- Choose **Databricks** if your priority is **machine learning, AI, or data lakehouse architecture**.  
- Many enterprises use **both together** â€” Snowflake for BI + Databricks for AI/ML.
