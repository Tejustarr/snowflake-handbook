# Snowflake vs. Redshift

Amazon Redshift was one of the first cloud data warehouses, while Snowflake is a newer, cloud-native competitor.

---

## 1. Architecture
- **Snowflake** â†’ True separation of compute and storage. Scales up or out instantly.  
- **Redshift** â†’ Clusters with local storage; scaling requires resizing or concurrency scaling add-ons.  

---

## 2. Pricing
- **Snowflake** â†’ On-demand compute billing (per-second) + storage.  
- **Redshift** â†’ Pay per-node (reserved or on-demand) + concurrency scaling credits.  

---

## 3. Performance
- **Snowflake** â†’ Automatic clustering, caching, pruning.  
- **Redshift** â†’ Requires vacuuming, distribution keys, and sort keys for performance tuning.  

---

## 4. Management
- **Snowflake** â†’ Fully managed SaaS (no maintenance).  
- **Redshift** â†’ Users manage clusters, vacuuming, scaling.  

---

## 5. Ecosystem
- **Snowflake** â†’ Works across AWS, Azure, GCP.  
- **Redshift** â†’ Best suited for AWS-native customers.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaway
- Choose **Snowflake** for **simplicity, scaling, and multi-cloud**.  
- Choose **Redshift** if you are **deeply tied to AWS** and want native service integration at potentially lower cost for stable workloads.
