# Snowflake vs. BigQuery

Both Snowflake and Google BigQuery are modern, cloud-native data warehouses â€” but they differ in architecture, pricing, and ecosystem fit.

---

## 1. Architecture
- **Snowflake** â†’ Separates compute and storage into independent layers; supports multi-cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP).  
- **BigQuery** â†’ Serverless model; users donâ€™t manage warehouses. Compute is auto-scaled by Google.  

---

## 2. Pricing
- **Snowflake** â†’ Pay for compute (per-second while warehouse is running) + storage.  
- **BigQuery** â†’ Pay per query (scanned data) or via flat-rate capacity pricing.  

ðŸ“Œ Takeaway: Snowflake is better for **long-running sessions and workloads**, BigQuery suits **sporadic queries**.

---

## 3. Performance
- **Snowflake** â†’ Manual warehouse sizing (XSâ€“6XL), multi-cluster for concurrency.  
- **BigQuery** â†’ Fully serverless; scales automatically.  

---

## 4. Ecosystem
- **Snowflake** â†’ Multi-cloud, integrates well with many BI/ETL/ML tools.  
- **BigQuery** â†’ Deeply integrated with Google Cloud ecosystem (Looker, Vertex AI).  

---

## 5. Key Strengths
- **Snowflake** â†’ Multi-cloud, workload isolation, strong security/governance.  
- **BigQuery** â†’ Serverless simplicity, great for ad-hoc analytics at scale.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaway
- Choose **Snowflake** if you want **multi-cloud flexibility** and workload control.  
- Choose **BigQuery** if youâ€™re already invested in **Google Cloud** and need **serverless scale**.
