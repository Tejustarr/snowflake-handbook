# Introduction

## What is Snowflake?  
Snowflake is a **cloud-native data platform** designed for storing, processing, and analyzing data.  
Unlike traditional databases, Snowflake was built for the cloud from the ground up, with a unique  
architecture that separates compute and storage for flexibility and efficiency.

## Key Features
- **Cloud-native**: Available on AWS, Azure, and GCP.  
- **Separation of compute & storage** → scale them independently.  
- **Pay-per-use model** → pay only for the compute/storage you use.  
- **Zero maintenance** → no servers or hardware to manage.  
- **High security & compliance** → encryption, RBAC, auditing.  

---

## Why Snowflake?
- Works with **structured and semi-structured data** (CSV, JSON, Parquet, Avro).  
- Supports **data sharing** without duplicating data.  
- **Elastic scaling** for small queries to enterprise-scale workloads.  
- Integrates easily with BI tools, ETL pipelines, and ML platforms.

## Real-world Use Cases
- **Business intelligence** → powering dashboards in Tableau, Power BI, Looker.  
- **ETL/ELT pipelines** → transforming raw data into analytics-ready formats.  
- **Machine learning** → providing training datasets for ML models.  
- **Cross-company collaboration** → securely sharing data with partners.

## Key Takeaway
Snowflake is not just a database — it’s a **data cloud** that combines the strengths of  
a data warehouse, data lake, and data-sharing platform into one.
