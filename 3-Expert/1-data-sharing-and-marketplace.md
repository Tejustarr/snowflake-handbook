# Data Sharing and Snowflake Marketplace

One of Snowflakeâ€™s defining features is its ability to **share data securely and instantly** across different accounts and even different organizations â€” without physically copying data.  
In addition, the **Snowflake Data Marketplace** enables organizations to publish and consume datasets globally.

## 1. Secure Data Sharing

### What is Secure Data Sharing?
- Allows Snowflake customers to share data with others in real time.  
- No copying or moving of data â€” consumers query the same storage layer.  
- Providers control access, ensuring **governance and security**.

### Benefits
- **Real-time access** â†’ Consumers always see the latest version.  
- **No duplication** â†’ Saves storage and ensures single source of truth.  
- **Granular control** â†’ Share at database, schema, or table level.

## 2. How Data Sharing Works

1. **Provider** creates a **share**:
   ```sql
   CREATE SHARE sales_share;
   GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE sales_db TO SHARE sales_share;
   GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA sales_db.analytics TO SHARE sales_share;
   ```

2. **Consumer** creates a database from the share:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE shared_sales_db FROM SHARE provider_account.sales_share;
   ```

3. Consumer queries the shared database as if it were local:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM shared_sales_db.analytics.customers;
   ```

ðŸ“Œ The consumer cannot modify shared data; they can only query it.

## 3. Data Marketplace

### What is the Snowflake Marketplace?
- A global exchange for datasets, available directly inside Snowflake.  
- Providers publish datasets; consumers discover and use them instantly.  
- Includes both free and paid datasets.  

### Types of Data Available
- Demographics  
- Financial market data  
- Weather and climate  
- Healthcare datasets  
- Location and geospatial data  
- Public datasets (e.g., COVID-19, government stats)  

### Example
- A retailer can enrich customer analytics by subscribing to demographic or location data.  
- A hedge fund can use financial market feeds for real-time decision-making.

## 4. Data Exchange (Private Sharing)

- Snowflake also supports **private data exchanges**.  
- Used by large organizations to share data securely across business units.  
- Provides marketplace-like capabilities, but restricted to internal teams.  

---

## 5. Security and Governance

- Providers control exactly what objects are shared.  
- Shares are read-only by default (safe by design).  
- Access is revoked instantly if needed.  
- All data remains encrypted and governed by Snowflakeâ€™s security model.  

---

## 6. Best Practices

- Share **schemas and views**, not raw tables, to control exposure.  
- Use **role-based access control** to manage share permissions.  
- For marketplace data, evaluate **update frequency and data freshness**.  
- Monitor data usage and costs when consuming external datasets.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaway
Snowflake enables a **data economy** by making secure, instant sharing possible.  
- **Secure Data Sharing** â†’ Controlled access without duplication.  
- **Marketplace** â†’ Access to thousands of third-party datasets.  
- **Private Exchanges** â†’ Internal marketplace for enterprises.  

This makes Snowflake not just a data warehouse, but a **global platform for data collaboration**.
