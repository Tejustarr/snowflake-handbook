# Testing & Validation of Adaptive Compute

## 🔍 Validation Strategies

1. **Performance Benchmarks**  
   Run same query with and without Adaptive Compute enabled. Compare latency.

2. **Cost Analysis**  
   Track credit consumption across workloads.

3. **Workload Simulation**  
   Run mixed BI + ML + batch queries and monitor auto-scaling.

---

## Automated Testing
Use CI pipelines to run benchmark suites nightly and store results.
