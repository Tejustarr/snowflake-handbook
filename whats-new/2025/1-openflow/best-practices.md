# Openflow Best Practices

Snowflake Openflow makes building data pipelines simpler and faster, but to use it effectively in production, follow these best practices.

---

## 1. Pipeline Design

- ✅ **Keep flows modular** → Break complex integrations into smaller, reusable pipelines.  
- ✅ **Separate ingestion and transformation** → Ingest raw data first, then apply transformations (dbt/Tasks).  
- ✅ **Use staging tables** → Land data in raw/staging tables before applying merges or analytics logic.  
- ❌ Don’t overload one pipeline with too many responsibilities — it reduces maintainability.

---

## 2. Performance Optimization

- ✅ **Batch small files** together before loading (e.g., combine CSVs) to reduce overhead.  
- ✅ **Compress files** (e.g., gzip, Parquet) for faster ingestion and lower storage.  
- ✅ Use **parallel flows** for high-volume ingestion (e.g., partition by region/date).  
- ❌ Avoid unnecessary transformations inside Openflow if they can be handled more efficiently in Snowflake SQL/dbt.

---

## 3. Reliability & Monitoring

- ✅ **Enable retries with backoff** for all connectors.  
- ✅ Configure **dead-letter queues (DLQs)** for failed records.  
- ✅ Set up **alerts** (e.g., email, Slack, monitoring dashboards) for failed runs.  
- ✅ Regularly review **Openflow logs and Snowflake query history**.  

---

## 4. Security & Governance

- ✅ Use **role-based access** for Openflow connections (principle of least privilege).  
- ✅ Mask or hash sensitive fields (PII, financial data) as early as possible.  
- ✅ Store credentials in **secure parameter stores or key vaults** instead of hardcoding.  
- ✅ Audit pipeline access and execution history regularly.  

---

## 5. Integration with Snowflake

- ✅ Use **Snowpipe** for continuous ingestion flows.  
- ✅ Leverage **streams and tasks** for downstream incremental updates.  
- ✅ Apply **dbt models** for transformations instead of coding them in Openflow.  
- ✅ Keep **naming conventions consistent** across stages, flows, and target tables.  

---

## 6. Maintenance & Scaling

- ✅ Version-control flow definitions (e.g., export to JSON/YAML in Git).  
- ✅ Document each pipeline’s purpose and dependencies.  
- ✅ Use separate environments (Dev → QA → Prod) to test flows before production.  
- ✅ Periodically clean up unused flows, connectors, and credentials.

## 📌 Key Takeaway

Design Openflow pipelines to be:
- **Modular** (small, focused flows).  
- **Reliable** (monitoring, retries, DLQs).  
- **Secure** (RBAC, masking, auditing).  
- **Integrated** (Snowpipe, Streams, dbt).  

By following these practices, you ensure that Openflow pipelines remain **scalable, maintainable, and production-ready**.
