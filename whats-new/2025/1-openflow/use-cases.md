# Openflow Use Cases

Snowflake Openflow enables flexible, secure, and scalable data integration.  
Here are common **business** and **technical** use cases where Openflow adds value.

---

## 1. Business Use Cases

### Customer 360 Analytics
- **Challenge**: Customer data exists across multiple CRMs, support systems, and marketing tools.  
- **Solution**: Use Openflow to ingest data from Salesforce, Zendesk, and HubSpot into Snowflake.  
- **Value**: Unified view of customer interactions â†’ better segmentation and personalization.

---

### Real-Time Sales Dashboards
- **Challenge**: Executives want near real-time sales tracking.  
- **Solution**: Configure Openflow with **SQL Server CDC** to continuously load new sales transactions.  
- **Value**: Dashboards in Tableau/Power BI update instantly, enabling faster decisions.

---

### Marketing Campaign Attribution
- **Challenge**: Attribution data is scattered across Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and internal logs.  
- **Solution**: Openflow pipelines pull API data and unify it in Snowflake.  
- **Value**: Accurate attribution reporting across campaigns â†’ improved ad spend efficiency.

---

### Healthcare Data Integration
- **Challenge**: Patient data resides in EHR systems and lab results files.  
- **Solution**: Openflow ingests HL7/JSON files and SQL sources into a governed Snowflake environment.  
- **Value**: Faster insights for clinicians while maintaining compliance (HIPAA).

---

## 2. Technical Use Cases

### 2.1 Database Change Data Capture (CDC)
- Capture inserts/updates/deletes from OLTP databases (SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle).  
- Apply changes incrementally into Snowflake tables.  
- Avoids full reloads â†’ efficient and real-time.

---

### 2.2 Streaming Data Ingestion
- Connect Kafka, Kinesis, or Pub/Sub to Snowflake via Openflow.  
- Stream clickstream, IoT, or log data directly into Snowflake.  
- Supports near real-time analytics.

---

### 2.3 File-Based ETL
- Ingest CSV, JSON, or Parquet files from S3/Azure Blob/GCS.  
- Apply lightweight transformations (filter, rename, map) before landing in tables.  
- Automates traditional file ingestion pipelines.

---

### 2.4 API Ingestion
- Call REST APIs (e.g., financial, weather, social media).  
- Store responses in VARIANT columns.  
- Combine with dbt for schema normalization.

---

### 2.5 Hybrid Pipelines
- Ingest â†’ Transform (Openflow + dbt) â†’ Schedule (Tasks) â†’ Consume (BI/ML).  
- Build full **ETL/ELT pipelines** entirely inside Snowflake.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaway

Openflow is useful for:
- **Business** â†’ Customer 360, sales dashboards, campaign attribution, healthcare integration.  
- **Technical** â†’ CDC, streaming, file ingestion, API pipelines, hybrid ETL.  

It bridges the gap between **raw data sources and Snowflake analytics**, reducing reliance on external ETL platforms.
