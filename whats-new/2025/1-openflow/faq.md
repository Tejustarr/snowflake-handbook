# Openflow FAQ

A collection of frequently asked questions about Snowflake Openflow, including limitations and troubleshooting tips.

---

## 1. General

**Q: What is Openflow in Snowflake?**  
A: Openflow is Snowflake‚Äôs native data integration engine (built on Apache NiFi) for ingesting, transforming, and routing data into Snowflake without relying on external ETL platforms.

**Q: How is Openflow different from Snowpipe?**  
A:  
- **Snowpipe** ‚Üí Continuous, automated file ingestion from stages into tables.  
- **Openflow** ‚Üí Broader pipelines: databases, APIs, streams, transformations, routing, and error handling.

## 2. Setup & Usage

**Q: Do I need to manage any servers for Openflow?**  
A: No. Openflow is fully managed by Snowflake as part of its SaaS model.

**Q: Can I design flows without coding?**  
A: Yes, Openflow provides a **drag-and-drop UI**. However, you can also script/deploy flows using CLI or APIs.

**Q: Can Openflow run transformations?**  
A: Yes, but best practice is to handle **heavy transformations inside Snowflake (SQL, dbt)**. Use Openflow for light transformations like filtering, mapping, or validation.

## 3. Connectors & Sources

**Q: What sources does Openflow support?**  
A: Databases (SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL), APIs (REST), cloud storage (S3, Azure Blob, GCS), and streaming platforms (Kafka, Kinesis, Pub/Sub).

**Q: Can I connect to on-prem databases?**  
A: Yes, via secure connectors and network policies, often through VPN or private connectivity.

---

## 4. Reliability & Monitoring

**Q: What happens if data ingestion fails?**  
A: Openflow supports retries with exponential backoff and can route failed records to **dead-letter queues (DLQs)** for inspection.

**Q: How do I monitor pipeline health?**  
A: Use Openflow‚Äôs monitoring dashboard and integrate alerts with external systems (e.g., Slack, PagerDuty, CloudWatch).

---

## 5. Security

**Q: Does Openflow store credentials?**  
A: Credentials are stored securely in Snowflake‚Äôs secrets manager. Avoid embedding them directly in flows.

**Q: Is Openflow HIPAA/PCI/GDPR compliant?**  
A: Yes, it inherits Snowflake‚Äôs compliance framework (SOC, HIPAA, PCI, GDPR, FedRAMP). Still, you must configure flows to mask or restrict sensitive data.

## 6. Limitations

- ‚ùå No support (yet) for very complex multi-step workflows with branching logic (better handled in orchestration tools).  
- ‚ùå Limited advanced transformations ‚Äî better to use dbt/Snowpark for those.  
- ‚ùå Pricing details may vary ‚Äî monitor credit usage when running frequent or high-volume pipelines.  
- ‚ùå Still evolving ‚Äî feature set will expand (check Snowflake release notes).  

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

- **Pipelines not starting?** ‚Üí Check warehouse availability and pipeline permissions.  
- **Data delays?** ‚Üí Inspect logs for retries, check source throttling, or resize warehouse.  
- **Unexpected schema issues?** ‚Üí Validate field mapping and ensure correct file format (CSV/JSON/Parquet).  
- **API rate limits?** ‚Üí Use throttling controls or batch requests in Openflow.

## üìå Key Takeaway

Openflow is powerful for **native ingestion and lightweight transformations**, but it‚Äôs best complemented with:  
- **Snowpipe** for file automation.  
- **dbt/Snowpark** for heavy transformations.  
- **Tasks/Streams** for orchestration.  

Together, these create a full **end-to-end data platform inside Snowflake**.
