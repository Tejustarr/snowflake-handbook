# Snowflake + dbt Integration (Feb 2025)

Welcome to the **Snowflake + dbt Integration** study collection â€” a deep, practical, and opinionated learning pack for analytics engineers, data platform engineers, and curious data professionals. This folder contains guided lessons, hands-on patterns, code snippets, CI/CD examples, performance guidance, and curated resources so you can run production-grade dbt on Snowflake with confidence.

## ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s inside this collection

- [intro.md](./intro.md) â€” Why dbt and Snowflake form a modern ELT powerhouse. Big-picture rationale and adoption patterns.
- [setup.md](./setup.md) â€” Step-by-step configuration for dbt Cloud and dbt Core, secure profiles, key-pair auth and GitHub Actions.
- [models-and-transformations.md](./models-and-transformations.md) â€” Model design, materializations, incremental patterns, snapshots, macros, and Snowflake-specific SQL recipes.
- [testing-and-documentation.md](./testing-and-documentation.md) â€” dbt tests, custom tests, docs site, auto-generated lineage, and governance patterns.
- [ci-cd.md](./ci-cd.md) â€” Continuous integration and deployment strategies, GitHub Actions and deployment promotion flows.
- [performance-and-best-practices.md](./performance-and-best-practices.md) â€” Query optimization, warehouse sizing, clustering, costs and monitoring.
- [resources.md](./resources.md) â€” Curated links, example repos, blogs, and community channels.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning outcomes (what youâ€™ll be able to do)

- Architect a dbt project designed to run efficiently on Snowflake.
- Implement safe incremental pipelines and snapshot patterns using MERGE and key-pair auth.
- Build a CI/CD pipeline that runs tests, docs, and promotes models across environments.
- Apply Snowflake-specific performance and cost optimizations for dbt workloads.
- Create reproducible documentation and lineage to satisfy stakeholders and auditors.
